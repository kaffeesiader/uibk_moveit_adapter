ros_control Installation intructions
====================================

Some packages depend on the newly created 'ros_control' stack, that is not included in the ROS-groovy
distribution. So it is necessary to download the required packages from github and build them
before building any other packages (if you are using ROS-hydro you can skip this steps):

1. Create a new CATKIN workspace or use your existing CATKIN workspace:
  
  mkdir ~/catkin_ws/src
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  catkin_init_workspace
  
2. Download the 'ros_control' source packages from github:

  git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control.git
  git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers.git -b groovy-backported-hydro
  git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/control_toolbox.git
  git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/realtime_tools.git
  
3. Check for any missing dependencies using rosdep:

  rosdep update
  rosdep check --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy
  
  // you can automatically install the missing dependencies using rosdep via debian install:
  
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y
  
4. Build the packages:

  cd ~/catin_ws
  catkin_make
  
  // the packages should now build without any problems
  
5. Source the catkin_ws setup.bash (better: include the following line into your .bashrc file)
   to ensure that the packages are visible to the build system!

  source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
  
6. Check, if the packages are located correctly.

  rospack find controller_manager
  
  // this should definitely point to the files in the catkin workspace and not those in the 
  // .../ros/groovy/stack !
  // otherwise something went wrong!
